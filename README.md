# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to visualize pathfinding algorithms and maze generation algorithms. The application currently supports Dijkstra's algorithm, A*, and recursive backtracking, with plans to implement more algorithms in the future.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git

2. Navigate to project directory and install dependencies:
   
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   
   npm install

4. Run the application in development mode:
   
    npm run dev

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can perform the following actions:

Place a start and finish cell to define the start and end points for the algorithm.

Place walls to block the path of the algorithm.

Adjust the visualization speed for the algorithm search and shortest path tracing.

Generate and visualize maze generation algorithms.

Adjust the visualization speed for maze generation.

Clear the graph and start over.
